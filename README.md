# VPC-with-servers-in-private-subnets-and-NAT-with-Load-Balancer
This project creates a production-ready VPC with servers deployed across two Availability Zones for resiliency. An Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer handle scaling and traffic distribution. Servers are placed in private subnets for security, with NAT gateways in each zone for internet access.
